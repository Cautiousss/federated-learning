# Federated Learning on Wearable Devices

This is the implementation of the paper: [Demo Abstract: Federated Learning on Wearable Devices](https://doi.org/10.1145/3384419.3430446).



## Requirements

+ Java 11



## Data

We setup our demo in a controlled environment with a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The dataset is built from a Daily and Sports Activities Data Set ([DSA](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Daily+and+Sports+Activities)), which comprises of motion sensor data of 19 daily sports activities each performed by 8 subjects in their own style for 5 minutes. 



## Model

The selected model is a **MLP**, composed of one input and one output layer, and one hidden layer with 1000 units using ReLU activations.
